# ðŸ’»ðŸ©º Remote Health Monitoring System
The Remote Health Monitoring System (RHMS) is a Java-based client-server application designed to monitor and manage patients' health data remotely. It simulates real-time data transmission between a patient device (client) and a central medical server.

By using classical TCP socket programming and a user-friendly Java Swing GUI, this system demonstrates how remote health tracking can be implemented effectively for chronic illness management and emergency response.

The application follows a modular, client-server design:

- **Client (Sensor Device):** Simulates patient-side sensors and transmits data.
- **Personal Server:** Acts as the decision-maker, evaluating incoming data.
- **Medical Server:** Receives abnormal health readings and handles alerts/logs.

All components communicate using TCP sockets to ensure reliable, ordered data transfer.
